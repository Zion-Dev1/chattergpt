## ‚ú® ChatterGPT ‚ú®
This is a full-stack application which is essentially a clone of ChatGPT. I wanted to gain some experience using the OpenAI API and thought this was a good project to do so.

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

If you wish to try out my project for yourself, follow these steps.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zion-Dev1/chattergpt.git
   cd chattergpt
   ```

2. Setup the client folder.

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. Setup the server folder
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```
   Then create a `.env` file in this folder and paste this:

   ```bash
   PORT=3000
   ```

   You will have to create your own MongoDB database and OpenAI API key as I cannot share mine. Once you have done that, paste them in the `.env` like so:

   ```bash
   DB_CONNECT=[your mongodb connection url]
   OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]
   ```

## Running the project üëü

Create 2 new command terminals, and make sure they are in the root directory (chattergpt). Then run `npm run client` and `npm run server` in a terminal respectively.

Then, navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the website.

Type in a query, hit ENTER and watch the OpenAI model answer your question ü§ñ
